# Tic-Tac-Toe AI

A graphical Tic-Tac-Toe game where you play against an unbeatable AI.

## Description

This project implements the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game using Python and Pygame. The computer opponent uses the **Minimax algorithm with Alpha-Beta Pruning** to calculate the optimal move, making it impossible to beat (the best outcome for a human player is a tie).
